**🌐 BERT News Topic Classifier: Procedure & Workflow
🔄 Overall Workflow**

Data Collection → Preprocessing → Tokenization
Model Fine-tuning → Evaluation → Deployment


📊**Step-by-Step Procedure**
**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
Dataset: AG News (120K headlines, 4 classes)
**Key Operations:**
Extract only headlines (ignore article descriptions)
**Clean text:**
Convert to lowercase
Remove special characters/URLs
Map labels:
World → 0, Sports → 1, Business → 2, Sci/Tech → 3
Split data:
Train (80%), Validation (10%), Test (10%)

**2. BERT Tokenization**
Tokenizer: bert-base-uncased

**Process:**
Add special tokens:
[CLS] at start (classification token)
[SEP] at end (separator token)
Split headlines into subword tokens (e.g., "playing" → ["play", "##ing"])
Pad/truncate sequences to 64 tokens
Generate attention masks (1 for real tokens, 0 for padding)

**3. Model Architecture**
Base Model: Pre-trained bert-base-uncased (12 transformer layers)

**Custom Head:**
Take final hidden state of [CLS] token (768-dim vector)
Add linear layer: 768 features → 4 output neurons (one per class)
Apply softmax for probability distribution

**4. Fine-Tuning**
Training Configuration:
Optimizer: AdamW (Learning Rate = 2e-5)
Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 3
Hardware: GPU acceleration (NVIDIA T4 recommended)

**Training Loop:**
Feed tokenized headlines + attention masks
Compare predictions vs. true labels → compute loss
Backpropagate errors → update weights
Validate after each epoch using validation set

**5. Evaluation**
Metrics:
Accuracy: % of correct predictions
Macro F1: Average F1-score across all classes

**Process:**
Run inference on test set (unseen during training)
Generate confusion matrix for error analysis

**6. Deployment (Streamlit)**
Core Components:
Load saved model/tokenizer
User input box for headlines
Real-time tokenization → prediction → confidence score

**Output:**
Predicted class (e.g., "Business")
Visual probability distribution

🧠 **Key Technical Insights**
⚙️ **How BERT Processes Headlines**
**Embedding Layer:**
Converts tokens → 768-dim vectors
Combines: Token + Position + Segment Embeddings
**Transformer Blocks:**
Self-Attention: Weights words based on context
Example: In "Apple stock rises", weighs "Apple" heavily for "Business"
**Feed-Forward Networks:** Non-linear transformations

**Classification Head:**
[CLS] vector → Global headline representation
Final layer → Class probabilities

🎯 **Why This Approach Works**
Transfer Learning: Leverages BERT's pre-trained knowledge (trained on Wikipedia + books)
Context Awareness: Understands word polysemy (e.g., "Java" ≠ island in tech news)
Efficiency: Achieves >93% accuracy with just 3 epochs

📈 **Performance Highlights**
Metric	Validation	Test
Accuracy	93.0%	93.2%
Macro F1	0.930	0.932
Inference Speed: 8 ms/headline (GPU)

🔮 **Future Enhancements**
Use DistilBERT for 2x faster inference
Incorporate article descriptions for ambiguous headlines
Add multi-label classification support
Deploy model quantization for edge devices
